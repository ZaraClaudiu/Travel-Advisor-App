Travel advisor is an app that shows you restaurants,
hotels and attractions of your current location, but you can
search for these things in other cities of your choice.
This application is full responsive: desktop/mobile
I used:
- Advanced React Best Practices, such as folder & file structure, hooks, and refs
- Creating a User Interface using Material UI
- Working with Google Maps API
- fetching data from unlimited sources using RapidAPI (JavaScript)Axios
